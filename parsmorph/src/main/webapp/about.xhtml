            <b>Pars Morph</b> is a rule-based Persian morphological analysis system, which analyzes the internal structure of word in Persian and determines the grammatical category and function of the word parts. Being in link with a lexicon covering about 45000 lexemes and based on morpho-logical rules in Persian, it can analyze the structure of complex lexemes and their possible inflected forms and even out-of-lexicon words.
